# Forecasting-data-Using-Dynamic-Factor-Model-and-Quantile-Regression

#### This page has been created to provide the R-code used in "Forecasting data Using Dynamic Factor Model and Quantile Regression."
#### It is recommended to read the '3.1_Monte-Carlo' document first to download the package.
#### (However, since the 'nowcasting' package has been removed from the CRAN repository, its available versions can be obtained from the archive.)

#### The data used in the empirical application can be obtained from the 'inflation data' file on the main page.
